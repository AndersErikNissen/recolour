A project created as part of a job application as a Fullstack developer

## 🧩 Start project

### 1️⃣ Install backend dependencies
`
cd backend
npm install
`

### 2️⃣ Seed the database (only if database.sqlite is not included)
`
node seed.js
`

### 3️⃣ Start the backend server
`
node server.js
`

> That runs the Express server on http://localhost:3000 _(The Vue app also runs on the same URL)_
